         Remmington Pascone began coding as an alternative to sitting around during quarantine, as her previous industries closed due to increased social-distancing protocols. Although originally from Florida, this currently-former professional touring musician, stage technician, and front-of-house service industry worker presently resides in Los Angeles, California, where she pretty much never leaves her apartment because people are everywhere. In the meantime, while waiting for the pandemic to end and people to become less scary, she finds learning to code really enjoyable and looks forward to looking up fewer things less often. </p>
